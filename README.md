# Chatbot

Chatbot from scratch using tensorflow.

Google colab is used to train the model where neural network train chatbot in action.

Tflearn over keras is used for 3 reasons:
Tflearn pytho arrays can be used directly.
Tflearn api is more closerto tensorflow code as compared to keras.
Tflearn gives better performance than keras.

chatbot framework essentially needs a document of question and answers and this will be used for deep learning model.
And that document is also provided as intent so that the pattern is quite understandable.
